Classification-Problem



This repository contains a project that applies supervised learning techniques to the breast cancer dataset from sklearn. The goal of the project is to implement five different classification algorithms to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on various features. The algorithms implemented in this project are Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN).

The breast cancer dataset is loaded from sklearn, and the features are preprocessed using standard scaling. The dataset is then split into training and test sets. Each classification algorithm is trained on the training set, and predictions are made on the test set. The performance of each algorithm is evaluated using accuracy scores and other metrics, such as precision, recall, and F1-score. The models are then compared to determine which one performed the best and which one performed the worst.

The notebook demonstrates the implementation of each algorithm step by step, along with performance evaluation for each one. The results are summarized in a comparison table, which allows for easy identification of the most effective model for this dataset.

To run this project, simply clone the repository, open the Jupyter notebook, and execute the cells to load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the models, and evaluate their performance.
